# Escrow Contract Reference

Location: `contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs`

## Overview

The StellarWork escrow contract manages a decentralized freelance marketplace on Stellar Soroban. It holds payments in escrow and releases them based on job lifecycle state transitions. The contract supports multiple whitelisted tokens, platform fee accounting, dispute resolution, and a timelocked upgrade mechanism.

## Data Model

### `Job` struct

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `client` | `Address` | The account that created and funded the job. |
| `freelancer` | `Option<Address>` | The account assigned to the job (`None` until accepted). |
| `amount` | `i128` | Total payment held in escrow (in the token's smallest unit). |
| `description_hash` | `BytesN<32>` | SHA-256 hash of the job description (all-zero hash is rejected). |
| `status` | `JobStatus` | Current lifecycle state of the job. |
| `created_at` | `u64` | Unix epoch seconds, set by `e.ledger().timestamp()` at `post_job` time. Read-only after creation. |
| `deadline` | `u64` | Unix epoch seconds, the latest time the job is active. Use `0` for no deadline. |
| `token` | `Address` | The whitelisted token contract used for payment. |
| `revision_count` | `u32` | Number of times the client has rejected submitted work (max 3). |

### `JobStatus` enum

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Open` | Job posted, awaiting freelancer acceptance. |
| `InProgress` | Freelancer accepted, work underway. |
| `SubmittedForReview` | Freelancer submitted work, awaiting client approval. |
| `Completed` | Work approved, payment released to freelancer (minus platform fee). |
| `Cancelled` | Job cancelled; funds returned to client or split per cancellation terms. |
| `Disputed` | Dispute raised; funds held until admin resolution. |

### `DisputeResolution` struct

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `client_bps` | `u32` | Basis-points share (0-10,000) awarded to the client. Remainder goes to freelancer after platform fee. |

Special cases:
- `10_000` — full refund to client, no fee, status becomes `Cancelled`
- `0` — full payout to freelancer minus fee, status becomes `Completed`
- Between `0` and `10_000` — split: client gets share (no fee on client portion), freelancer gets remainder minus fee

## Upgrade Mechanism

The contract supports a two-step upgrade process with a 24-hour timelock:

1. **Propose**: Admin calls `propose_upgrade(admin, new_wasm_hash)`.
2. **Wait**: 24 hours must elapse.
3. **Execute**: Admin calls `execute_upgrade(admin)` after the deadline.
4. **Cancel**: Admin may call `cancel_upgrade(admin)` at any point before execution.

## Token Whitelist

The contract maintains a whitelist of allowed token addresses. Only whitelisted tokens can be used for job payments.

- The `native_token` passed to `initialize` is automatically whitelisted.
- Admin can add tokens via `add_allowed_token(token)`.
- Admin can remove tokens via `remove_allowed_token(token)`.
- `post_job` validates the token is whitelisted before accepting payment.
- Each job stores its token address for use during payout.

## Storage TTL Management

The contract uses Soroban's storage TTL extension to manage ledger entry lifetimes:

- **Instance storage**: Extended on every state-changing call.
- **Active jobs**: Extended with a longer bump amount (518,400 ledgers).
- **Archival jobs** (Completed/Cancelled): Extended with a shorter bump (120,960 ledgers).
- **Token fees**: Extended when fees are accrued or withdrawn.
