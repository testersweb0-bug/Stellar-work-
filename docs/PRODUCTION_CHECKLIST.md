# Production Launch Checklist

Pre-launch checklist for deploying StellarWork to production. Complete every item and record the result before going live. Do not skip items — each one protects users or funds.

> Work through this checklist in order. Items in earlier sections must be complete before later sections are meaningful.

---

## How to Use This Checklist

- Work through each section top-to-bottom.
- Mark each item ✅ when complete or ❌ if blocked (note the blocker inline).
- Assign a responsible person and a completion timestamp for each section.
- Keep a copy of the completed checklist in the deployment log.
