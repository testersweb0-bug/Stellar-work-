StellarWork is an open-source decentralized freelance marketplace on Stellar. Payments are held in Soroban escrow and released by state transitions, not platform custody logic.

## Local Setup

### Using Docker (Recommended)

You can spin up the full development environment with a single command (requires Docker installed):

```bash
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
docker compose up -d
```

This starts:
- **frontend** — Next.js dev server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with hot-reload
- **contract-builder** — Rust + Soroban CLI environment for building/testing contracts
- **stellar-quickstart** — Local Stellar dev network with Soroban RPC at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

File changes in `frontend/` will trigger hot-reload inside the container automatically.

To run contract tests inside the container:

```bash
docker compose exec contract-builder cargo test --manifest-path contracts/escrow/Cargo.toml
```

Common commands are also available via Makefile:

```bash
make up      # Start all services
make down    # Stop all services
make test-contract  # Run contract unit tests
make test-frontend  # Run frontend unit tests
```

### Manual Setup

#### 1) Contract

```bash
cd contracts/escrow
cargo test
```

### 2) Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 3) Pre-commit Hooks (Optional)

To automate quality checks, see the [pre-commit setup guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#pre-commit-hooks-optional) in the contribution docs.

## Deploy Contract to Stellar Testnet (Step-by-Step)

This walkthrough takes you from build to frontend integration with copy-pasteable commands.

### 1) Prerequisites

- Install Soroban CLI ([docs](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup)).
- Have a funded Stellar Testnet account.
- Configure a Soroban identity:

```bash
soroban config identity generate stellarwork-admin
soroban config identity address stellarwork-admin
```

- Add Testnet network (if not already configured):

```bash
soroban config network add testnet \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
```

### 2) Build the Escrow Contract

```bash
cd contracts/escrow
cargo test
soroban contract build
```

Expected wasm output:

```bash
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/escrow.wasm
```

### 3) Deploy to Testnet

```bash
cd contracts/escrow
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/escrow.wasm \
  --source stellarwork-admin \
  --network testnet
```

Save the returned contract ID (for example `CC...`).

### 4) Initialize Contract State

`initialize(admin, native_token)` must be called once.

1. Determine your admin address:

```bash
soroban config identity address stellarwork-admin
```

2. Choose a native token contract address on testnet (or your token contract).
3. Invoke initialize:

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source stellarwork-admin \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --native_token <NATIVE_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

### 5) Configure Frontend Environment

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Set at minimum:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID=<CONTRACT_ID>
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
```

See `docs/environments.md` for the complete environment variable reference, defaults, and Testnet/Mainnet notes.

Then run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 6) Verify Deployment

Read methods should return values without requiring a signed transaction:

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network testnet \
  -- get_job_count
```

### Troubleshooting

- **`HostError: Error(Contract, #...)` on write calls**: check caller authorization and method preconditions.
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID is not configured`**: confirm `frontend/.env.local` and restart `npm run dev`.
- **`contract not found` / RPC errors**: verify `--network testnet` and correct contract ID.
- **Initialize appears to do nothing**: this contract ignores repeated `initialize` calls after first setup.
- **Insufficient balance on deploy/invoke**: fund the identity from Stellar Friendbot and retry.

## Current Feature Set

- Core escrow lifecycle (`post_job`, `accept_job`, `submit_work`, `approve_work`, `cancel_job`)
- Freelancer-initiated job cancellation with penalty (`freelancer_cancel_job`)
- On-chain job storage and count queries
- Multi-token support with admin-managed whitelist (`add_allowed_token`, `remove_allowed_token`)
- IPFS-based job description storage via web3.storage (with localStorage fallback)
- Platform fee accounting (2.5%)
- Dispute resolution with flexible client/freelancer splits
- Contract upgrade mechanism with 24-hour timelock
- Contract unit tests for core paths
- Core pages: `/`, `/post-job`, `/job/[id]`, `/dashboard`, `/admin`, `/disputes`, `/profile/[address]`

## Environment Configuration

Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env.local` and set the required variables:

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID` | Yes | — | Deployed escrow contract ID |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK` | No | `testnet` | `testnet` or `mainnet` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC` | No | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` | Soroban RPC endpoint |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NATIVE_TOKEN` | No | — | Default token address for post-job form |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ADDRESS` | No | — | Admin wallet for UI access control |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_GATEWAY_URL` | No | `https://dweb.link/ipfs/` | IPFS gateway for descriptions |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3_STORAGE_TOKEN` | No | — | Web3.storage token for IPFS uploads |

The frontend validates configuration at runtime via `lib/config.ts`. Missing required variables produce clear error messages. See `docs/environments.md` for the full reference including Testnet/Mainnet notes.

## Vercel Deployment

The frontend is deployed to Vercel automatically:

- **Production** — every push to `main` that changes `frontend/**` triggers a production deployment.
- **Preview** — every pull request gets a unique preview URL, posted as a comment by the GitHub Actions bot.

See [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md) for the full setup guide (creating the Vercel project, required GitHub secrets, environment variable configuration, and troubleshooting).

For a command-only deployment reference, see `docs/testnet-deployment-guide.md`.
For environment configuration, see `docs/environments.md`.
For API reference, see `docs/CONTRACT.md`.
For frontend architecture, see `docs/FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
For third-party integration, see `docs/INTEGRATION.md`.

For the full documentation index, see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## Production Operations

For deploying and operating StellarWork in production, start with these three documents:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) | Step-by-step production deployment: contract build/deploy/initialize, Vercel frontend, DNS/SSL, post-deploy verification |
| [docs/OPS_RUNBOOK.md](docs/OPS_RUNBOOK.md) | Ongoing operations: monitoring signals, backup procedures, incident response, contract upgrades, regular maintenance |
| [docs/PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md](docs/PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md) | Pre-launch checklist with sign-off table — complete before going live |

## Video Tutorials

Step-by-step video walkthroughs for the most common workflows. Videos are recorded on Stellar testnet — no real funds are used.
